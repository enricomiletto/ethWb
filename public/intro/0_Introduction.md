# Introduction to Programming in C++

The goal of this website is to provide you quick references to the material seen in class, without the overwhelming amount of informations that you would for example find on [CppReference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/). 

The current version of the website is available on my [Github](https://github.com/samuel0007/ethWb), please feel free to open any issues you would like to point out under the _Issues_ tab of the repository.

## How to make the most out of the lecture

<ol class="list-decimal">
<li><b>Do the weekly exercises and the bonus exercises.</b> During the exam, you will be alone in front of your screen, so try to solve the exercises individually. But don't hesitate to ask for hints around you when you get stuck, and to review exercises in groups.</li>
<li><b>Don't compare yourself to others.</b> The level gap in the 1st year of the curriculum is gigantic. Some of you might have learned programming when they were 12, already worked as software engineers, ... and some might also never have used a CLI until now. So it's useless to compare yourself to others, just do your best!</li>
<li> I recommend to <b>watch the lectures live (on Zoom or face-to-face)</b>, as the fix schedule will help you getting into the right rythm of work.</li>
<li> If you are a beginner with programming in C++, play around in the <a href="https://expert.ethz.ch/">CodeExpert</a> playground to try out your intuition. </li>
<li> If you are experienced and need some challenges, try out online competitive programming platform as <a href="https://codeforces.com/">codeforces</a>. But don't forget that for the exam, you will need to know the structure of Object Oriented Programming and some theoritical details about basic arithmetics (integers and floating points), recursion, and pointers in C++, so I'd still recommend to watch carefully the lecture. </li>

## How to prepare for the exam

<ol class="list-decimal">
<li><b> Winter exams are like a 100m, summer exams are like a marathon.</b></br> I would recommend to really give your best for the winter session, as you can then see how much and how you have to study for the summer exams. So take a short break with your family for Christmas and then prepare yourself at the starting blocks ! </li>
<li><b>Do as many old exams as you can.</b></br> As the exams for this lecture doesn't change so much from year to year (though the programming part gets bigger and bigger), preparing yourself by doing old exams is really the best way to prepare yourself for the real one.</li>
<li> If you fail a task on an old exam, it's really important <b>take time to go through the solution carefully, and redo the task without the solution to be sure that you've fully understand it.</b></li>
</ol>
